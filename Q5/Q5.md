A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small graphical icon associated with a website or web page. It is typically displayed in the browser's address bar, tabs, bookmarks, and other places where the website's identity needs to be represented in a compact form. Favicon images are usually square and are often in the .ico file format, although other image formats like .png can also be used.

example of how to define a favicon in the HTML code of a web page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>My Website</title>

    <!-- Define the Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" />

    <!-- Optionally, define a Favicon for iOS devices -->
    <link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="apple-touch-icon.png" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your website content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example:

1. The `<link>` element with the `rel` attribute set to "icon" specifies the location of the favicon file using the `href` attribute. It points to a file named "favicon.ico." The "type" attribute indicates that the file is in the .ico format.

2. Optionally, the code also includes a link to an Apple Touch Icon for iOS devices using the `<link>` element with `rel="apple-touch-icon"`. This icon is used when a user saves the website to their home screen on an iOS device. It's recommended to provide this icon in various sizes to ensure it looks good on different iOS devices.

Including a favicon is a small but essential aspect of web design and branding. It helps users easily identify your website when they have multiple tabs open in their browser or when they bookmark site, contributing to a more cohesive and professional web presence.
